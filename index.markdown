## Summary of the workshop

Distributed algorithms is an active research field; their applications range
from Internet applications over cloud computing to safety-critical control
systems. Whereas many applications are of critical importance, the correctness
of distributed algorithms is usually based on very subtle mathematical
arguments. Consequently, one easily can make mistakes with hand-written proofs,
which reduces the trust in the correctness of these systems.

In the last decades, formal methods were proven to be useful for the
verification of many hardware and software systems. For distributed algorithms,
the application of formal methods was limited: formal methods have been used
for finding bugs in distributed algorithms, and to a much smaller extent formal
methods were used in computer-aided verification of simple distributed
algorithms. However, to verify more involved distributed algorithms, one cannot
easily apply existing verification tools. To be eventually able to do this, an
interdisciplinary effort from the concerned fields of formal methods, logic in
computer science, and distributed algorithm theory is required.

The topics of interest for the FRIDA workshop include the following topics, as
they apply to distributed algorithms and systems:

* formal modeling
* model checking
* interactive theorem proving
* parameterized model checking
* integration of different verification techniques
* benchmarking
* synthesis
* run-time verification
* testing
* invariant inference

## Previous editions

Starting a productive dialogue between distributed algorithms and verification
communities was the goal of a successful [Dagstuhl Seminar “Formal Verification
of Distributed Algorithms”](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=13141)
which was held in April 2013. During this seminar,
the participants agreed that a series of workshops should be held in order to
strengthen the community that does research on these issues.

The [1st workshop on Formal Reasoning in Distributed
Algorithms](https://easychair.org/smart-program/VSL2014/FRIDA-index.html) took
place in Vienna as part of the Vienna Summer of Logic’14 and Federated Logic
Conference’14. The [2nd FRIDA
workshop](http://discotec2015.inria.fr/workshops/frida-2015/) took place in
Grenoble as part of FORTE’15. The [3rd FRIDA
workshop](https://forsyte.at/events/frida2016/) was organized in Marrakech as
part of NETYS’16. The [4th FRIDA
workshop](https://forsyte.at/events/frida2017/) took place in Vienna as part of
DISC 2017. The [5th FRIDA workshop](https://forsyte.at/events/frida2018/) was
co-located with CAV 2018, which was held as part of the Federated Logic
Conference (FLoC). The [6th
workshop](https://team.inria.fr/veridis/events/frida2019/) was co-located with
DISC 2019 in Budapest, Hungary. Finally, [FRIDA 2020](https://frida2020.galois.com/) and [FRIDA 2021](frida-2021.github.io) took place as an online workshops at QONFEST 2020 and DISC 2021, respectively.
